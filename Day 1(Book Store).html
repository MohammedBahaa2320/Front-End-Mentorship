        <p> Future Frontend is a single track conference series focused on examining the current trends in the space of frontend web development. To get a better idea of our events, see the archives for 2023 and 2024.</p>
        <p> To quote William Gibson, the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed. The purpose of Future Frontend conference is to give you a glimpse of future. The third edition takes place 27-28 May, 2025 (Dipoli, Espoo, Finland) while the workshops are held 26th of May, 2025 around Helsinki.</p>
        <h3> Quality over quantity </h3>
        <p> Historically our events have been small (up to 300 people for React Finland) and we tend favor quality over quantity in both terms of content and attendees. Our single track format, ample breaks, and additional program allow you to gain understanding of what is going in the field while gaining new acquaintances. </p>
